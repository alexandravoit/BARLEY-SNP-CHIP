# METK Barley SNP-Chip: Exploring the correlation between barley’s genetic makeup and its protein content
## Agnes Kivistik, Liselle Velner, Alexandra Voit 
Barley is a nutritious grain that can grow even in harsher climates and contains considerable amounts of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It is widely used as animal feed, however, it is also a staple in Estonia’s traditional cuisine. We obtained very interesting data from the METK biotechnology department about barley harvested in 2024 which in turn inspired our research: barley’s agricultural significance led us to explore the potential connection between the plant’s various attributes and its SNP composition (meaning its DNA makeup). We decided to narrow our scope to the grain’s protein content, as plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular, and the protein amount per 100g of barley is both nutritionally important for consumers as well as crucial for farmers when selecting crop varieties.

The goal of this project is to lay the groundwork for improving barley’s nutritional composition by hopefully identifying genetic factors linked to its protein content. By establishing a connection, we could facilitate larger studies that take into account barley’s other attributes as well - these include grain size, proneness to diseases, growth time etc. This knowledge could prove useful in crop breeding.
